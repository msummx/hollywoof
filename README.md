# HOLLYWOOF

## About

Hollywoof is a dog-themed movie curation app that lets the user personalize their recommendation through a series of questions asking about movie length, release date windows, and genres. Each answer they are able to select is represented through a dog image. Once a movie is chosen, the HTML of the page updates so that the movie recommendation is displayed, alongside a random dog image to go with the theme.
